- shared components are files that are used in several pages.
- core components are components without product specific logic
- public contains the assets
- update-icons.sh file creates the generated folder in src from the public folder according to the internal configuration. there is a dedicated script to run it
- scripts for automated processes are under scrripts folder
- component that has dependencies on other components can use core, shared components and components defined in its folder under components folder. create one when adding direct components and place there
- each component has its own folder. the css modules file has the same name as the component.
- prefer using *.ts files if it does not contain JSX
- file names matches component names (e.g. MyComponent will be in my-component.tsx file and the style will be in my-component.module.scss, constants will be in constants.ts file and utils in utils.ts file, sub components in components/my-sub-component/my-sub-component.tsx)
- do not add comments in files for explanations
