# Required Steps (in order)
1. Monday Task ID:
   - Extract the ID from the end of the branch name (numbers after last dash)
   - Replace <monday-item-id> in the template with this ID
   - Example: branch "feature/add-button-12345" â†’ ID is "12345"
   - If no ID in branch name, ask the user to provide it

2. Description and Template:
   - Use default github template at .github/pull_request_template.md
   - ALWAYS create PR body by copying the template first: cp .github/pull_request_template.md pr-body.md
   - Replace <!-- details --> with details about the changes this PR contains exactly where the placeholder is, preserving surrounding whitespace
   - DO NOT add any extra newlines or modify existing formatting
   - Ensure the Monday task link is in format: https://organization.monday.com/boards/2988776541/pulses/<monday-item-id>

3. Checklist Management:
   - Ask which tasks are relevant and which are completed
   - For completed and relevant tasks: replace "[ ]" with "[x]"
     Example: "- [x] checked DEV mode"
   - For irrelevant tasks: wrap with "~" and mark with [x]
     Example: "-   [x] ~checked MOCK mode~"

# GitHub CLI Instructions
When creating or updating pull requests using GitHub CLI (gh):
- For multiline descriptions, use one of these methods:
  1. Pipe echo with proper newlines:
     ```bash
     echo -e "Description with\nproper\nnewlines" | gh pr create --title "title" --body-file - --base dev
     ```
  2. Or use a temporary file:
     ```bash
     echo "Description with
     proper
     newlines" > pr_body.txt
     gh pr create --title "title" --body-file pr_body.txt --base dev
     ```
- ALWAYS use --body-file with gh pr create/edit commands, NEVER use --body directly
- Create the body file by copying the template: cp .github/pull_request_template.md pr-body.md
- Use proper newline escapes (\n) when using echo -e
- Maintain proper indentation in the description for readability
- After PR creation, delete the temporary pr-body.md file
